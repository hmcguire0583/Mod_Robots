Implementation of the locate and free algorithm by DFS -> Harry, Russ, and Fouad

TO DO:
1. Take code made and make new LocateAndFree class
    - Make a friend to Lattice
2. Create function to find the start S (Greatest Z, then smallest X & Y)
3. Find a way to print path of DFS (starting from S)
4. After the end of DFS move block one direction Towards smallest
5. Create a configuration in 3d to test.
